# ENSIMISMARSE

Ensimismarse is a Rust library that allows basic manipulation of mathematical expressions. So far, elementary expressions can be created and then differentiated, simplified, and evaluated using the functions provided.

## Overview

This project is still in its early stages. However, almost any elementary function encountered in a first-year calculus course can be differentiated using this libary. Any composition of the following operations and functions can be differentiated

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Trigonometric Functions (sin,cos,tan,sec,csc,cot)
- Hyperbolic Trig Functions (cosh,sinh,tanh,sech,csch,coth)
- Exponential and Logarithm
- Powers of x, N'th Roots of x

Functions, represented by the <code>Expr</code> struct in the library, can also be evaluated given a vector containing the numerical values of the variables. They may also be simplified (although this feature is still limited in its scope).

## Usage

TO-DO -- I have yet to finish this as a library haha.
